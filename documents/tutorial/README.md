# Annalist Tutorial

The Annalist tutorial in this directory is drafted using AsciiDoc.  Github provides a rough rendition [directly from the repository](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/develop/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.adoc, but a better rendering is available as `annalist-tutorial.html`.

To view the improved rendering, checkout the repository files and load file `annalist-tutorial.html` into a browser.  The images and stylesheets used should be picked up from the same directory.

A version of the rendered HTML is also maintained on the annalist demo site, and can be viewed at http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html.  It is likely that this version will lag the version maintained in GitHub, but it should be updated as part of the software release cycle.
