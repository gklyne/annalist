## Field value modes

As well as different data presentations provided by field render types, the rendered values can be accessed in a number of different ways determined by a field value mode:

1. Direct value: the field value is the rendered value, or a URI reference to an an attached or external resource to be displkayed (depending on the render type used).
2. Imported resource: Reference to an imported attached resource
3. Uploaded resource: Reference to an uploaded attached resource
4. Indirect entity: Reference to an entity of a designated type
5. Indirect field: Reference to a field of an entity of a designated type (which may indicate an attached resource)

These different modes are primarily determined a "Value mode" field in the field description, as follows:


### Value mode: `Value_direct`

This mode invokes direct access to a field of the current entity, for both editing and viewing.  The render type determines how that value is presented.

Some render types (e.g. `RefImage`, `RefAudio`) treat the value as a reference to a resource, and when viewing an entity will present a rendering (e.g., image or audio player) of the referenced resource.

The "Field value type" field (`Field_type`) identifies the type of value presented (e.g. `annal:Text`, `annal:Identifier` or `annal:Image`), and the "Enum type" field (`Field_typeref`) and "Referenced field" field (`Field_fieldref`) are unspecified or blank.


### Value mode: `Value_import`

This mode invokes access to an attachment to the current entity that is imnported from an external location on the web, and is used with render types that expect a resource reference (e.g. `RefImage`, `RefAudio`).

When editing an entity, a text box is provided for a URL, and an `Import` button that can be clicked to fetch a copy of the resource at the designated location and store it as an attachment of the current entity.

When viewing an entity, this mode works in the same way as `Value_direct`.


### Value_mode: `Value_upload`

This mode invokes access to an attachment to the current entity that is uploaded from a user's local file system via a browser form, and is used with render types that expect a resource reference (e.g. `RefImage`, `RefAudio`).

When editing an entity, a file browser control is provioded that can be used to select a file to upload when the form is saved.

When viewing an entity, this mode works in the same way as `Value_direct`.


### Value mode: `Value_field`

This mode invokes access to a field in a linked entity.

When editing the containing entity, the field is displayed as a drop-down box of available entities.

The "Field value type" field (`Field_type`) identifies the type of value presented (e.g. `annal:Text`, `annal:Identifier` or `annal:Image`), the "Enum type" field (`Field_typeref`) indicates the type of the referenced entity, and the "Referenced field" field (`Field_fieldref`) is the property URI of the field of the referenced entity that is presented.

When viewing an entity, the named field in the referenced entity is retrieved and displayed according to the value renderer selected.  Some render types (e.g. `RefImage`, `RefAudio`) treat the value as a reference to a resource, and when viewing an entity will present a rendering (e.g., image or audio player) of the resource referenced by the indicated field;  this can be used to display an attachment from a linked entity.

For example, if images are all uploaded as attachments to a single entity type, those images can be referenced and displayed by any number of other entities.  This avoids the need to upload a separate copy of the image for each entity that displays it. @@add link to example at annalist.net@@


### Value mode: `Value_entity`

This mode invokes access to a field in a linked entity.

When editing the containing entity, the field is displayed as a drop-down box of available entities.

The "Field value type" field (`Field_type`) is the type URI of the referenced entity, the "Enum type" field (`Field_typeref`) indicates the internal type identifier of the referenced entity, and the "Referenced field" field (`Field_fieldref`) is unspecified or blank.

When viewing an entity, the referenced entity is retrieved as a complex (dictionary) value, and displayed according to the value renderer selected.  In practice, this would be a `RefMultfield` renderer indicating a field group defining one or more fields to be displayed from the referenced entity.

For example, if images are all uploaded as attachments to a single entity type, along with descriptions of those images, then those images and descriptions can be referenced by a single field in the referencing entity. @@add link to example at annalist.net@@
