# Notes for Annalist community building

## As of 2015-09-22

Although Annalist development has been open from the outset, it has initially been conducted as a personal project with limited wider engagement.  Using Annalist with the [FAST](http://www.semanticaudio.ac.uk/) and [CREAM](https://blog.soton.ac.uk/cream/) projects has provided much valuable feedback to guide its development, but these collaborations have not been so far pressed beyond using Annalist as an information model prototyping tool.

A longer term goal has always been to try to develop Annalist as a community open source project.  The rough plan has been to develop the system to a viable "version 1" release, and then to promote its use more widely.  A concern has been that starting promotion too early, before it can readily be used by its target audience, will result in potential users being turned off by poor early experiences.


## Community building strategy

I envisage a 3-pronged approach:

"Pull" - promote use of Annalist to research users; target domains: digital humanities, bioinformatics, etc.  Seek out uers who have unmet data management needs and draw up a shortlist of new pilot projects, and work with these to create Annalist collections as both exemplars and initial structures that can be used to bootstrap new applications.  The choice of user partners here would be opportunistic rather than predetermined, taking advantage of available contacts and interests, and particularly aiming to identify and address unmet needs that fall within the Annalist's scope.

"Push" - engage with service providers with a view to deploying Annalist as a service: universities, cloud providers, JISC, etc.  This would serve two goals: (a) to make facilities available to users who wish to use Annalist, and (b) to engage a community who could provide additional development capacity to continue enhancing Annalist's ability to meet users needs.

"Feedback" - an important outcome of engaging with end users will be gathering feedback that is used to guide further development of Annalist, and to help refine its positioning (scope) and support materials.  (In responding to feedback, it will be important to constrain scope creep by looking to enhancements that facilitate use with other existing tools, rather than simply adding capabilities to Annalist.)


## Outline plan

1. prepare a community project governance model and sustainability plan, and seek community review (use [Shuffl sustainability plan](https://github.com/gklyne/shuffl/blob/wiki/OpenSourceSustainabilityPlan.md) as starting point)

2. approach existing contacts to identify possible pilot projects (e.g. HW-C, Zoology, Humanities, ResearchSpace, Marco, Manchester, ISA-tab, ...)

3. seek out new user contacts, and approach with a view to identifying pilot projects

4. approach service departments, in Oxford and elsewhere, with a view to deploying Annalist as a service for research groups.

5. identify possible funding channels for ongoing development and support, and submit bids to bring in additional support and training resources to join and promote an Annalist development and support community.  This might best be handled through partnerships forged at steps 3 and 4 above.

6. identify appropriate technology and domain conferences and submit poster/demo presentations, with a view to engaging with both potential users and developers.  I shall consider poster/demo submissions to the Web Conference and ISWC.
