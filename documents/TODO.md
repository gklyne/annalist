# Towards V0.1.4

- [ ] annalist-manager option to update site data, leaving the rest untouched
- [ ] annalist-manager initialize: needs to create `.annalist/providers` directory [#27](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/27).
- [ ] Update view and field descriptions [#16](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/16)
- [ ] List headings are clutter [#26](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/26)
- [ ] 'Select' label for field type is un-obvious [#25](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/25)
- [ ] New entities are initially populated with useless junk [#24](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/24)
- [ ] Authorization [#11](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/11)
- [ ] Extend form-generator capabilities [#2](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/2)
- [ ] Grid view [#7](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/7)
- [ ] Can't rename locally created Default_view [#22](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/22)
- [ ] Linked data support [#19](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/19)
    - [ ] JSON-LD @contexts support
    - [ ] Alternative RDF formats support
    - [ ] Think about use of CURIES in data (e.g. for types, fields, etc.)  Need to store prefix info with collection.  Think about base URI designation at the same time, as these both seem to involve JSON-LD contexts.
    - [ ] Link browsing?
    - [ ] Easy access to entity links?
    - [ ] URI to URL lookup?
- [ ] Additional test cases [#8](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/8)
- [ ] Code and service review  [#1](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/1)
