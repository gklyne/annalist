# Towards V0.1.4

- [x] annalist-manager option to update site data, leaving the rest untouched
- [x] annalist-manager initialize: needs to create `.annalist/providers` directory [#27](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/27).
- [x] Update view and field descriptions [#16](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/16)
    - [x] extend field edit form to include additional fields used.
    - [x] extend view edit form to include additional fields used in sitedata (i.e. record_type)
    - [x] add more 'annal:field_entity_type' constraints for fields that are intended to be used only with specific entity types (e.g. fields, views, etc.)
    - [x] List view also needs 'annal:field_entity_type' to control selection
        - [x] Add field manually to internal list descrptions
        - [x] Add field to List_view
    - [x] Remove "Default_field"
- [x] Blank value in submitted form is ignored [#30](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/30)
- [x] List headings are clutter [#26](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/26)
- [x] Clean up page and section headings in record editing view
- [x] 'Select' label for field type is un-obvious [#25](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/25)
- [x] New entities are initially populated with useless junk [#24](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/24)
    - initialization logic is in models.entitytypeinfo.get_initial_entity_values
- [ ] Change type of entry doesn't delete old record [#29](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/29)
- [ ] Default button on view edit form (and others) should be "Save".
- [ ] Authorization [#11](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/11)
- [ ] Extend form-generator capabilities [#2](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/2)
- [ ] Grid view [#7](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/7)
- [x] Can't rename locally created Default_view [#22](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/22)
    - [x] Fix upÂ default action resulting from click on link may need to change later when read only views introduced
    - [x] Additional authorization check if Save called with unexpected action
    - [x] Update authorization reporting to say what access (scope) was requested, rather than HTTP method
- [ ] Linked data support [#19](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/19)
    - [ ] JSON-LD @contexts support
    - [ ] Alternative RDF formats support
    - [ ] Think about use of CURIES in data (e.g. for types, fields, etc.)  Need to store prefix info with collection.  Think about base URI designation at the same time, as these both seem to involve JSON-LD contexts.
    - [ ] Link browsing?
    - [ ] Easy access to entity links?
    - [ ] URI to URL lookup?
- [ ] Additional test cases [#8](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/8)
- [ ] Code and service review  [#1](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/1)
- [ ] Security and robust deployability enhancements [#12](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/12)
