# Features dropped from roadmap

This document is an archive of featires that were once considered to be omn the Annalist development roadmap, but which have since appeared to wane in importnace.


## Research objects

Mechanisms for packaging to submitting to RO repositories.  Could be based on [DIP work](https://github.com/CottageLabs/dip), etc.


## Extended data types and presentation options

Numbers, Dates, Georeferences, etc.

I also want to look into using "live" links, e.g. to obtain georeference coordinates or environment sensor data for inclusion into data records.

Notes:

- more field types, including link browser
    - image grid + metadata pop-up for mobile browsing?
- see also: discussion with Cerys, and philosophy of minimal hurdles to data entry
