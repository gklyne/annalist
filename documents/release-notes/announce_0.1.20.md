### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.20

I've just released an update (0.1.20) to the public prototype of Annalist.  This release has tackled a number of usability issues, and in particular introduces "task buttons" that provide short cuts for some commonly performed configuration activities:

* creating view and list definitions for a new record type
* creating field and group definitions for a repeated field group
* creating field and group definitions for displaying fields from a linked record

An [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) document has been created.  It is still in a very drafty form, but it provides a more task-oriented desription of Annalist capabilities.

Other changes include:

* Simple links no longer include continuation URIs.  This means that the link URLs are more consistently usable as identifiers.
* Closing top-level list displays no longer return to the site home page, but rather redisplay the collection default view.  This has the effect of making collections more "sticky" in the sense that a user is less likely to find they are unexpectedly looking at some completely different data collection.
* A number of changes to data presentation.
* Various bug fixes.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

As always, the live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
