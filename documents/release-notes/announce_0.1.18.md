To Google group:

I've just released an update (0.1.18) to the public prototype of Annalist.

This release introduces several interface changes to address usability problems, 
bug-fixes, and embodies some fairly extensive changes to the internal code structure.

New features include:
* an option to reorder repeated field entries in a view (via move up/down buttons)
* ability to declare simple type hierarchies with different presentation of subtypes.  
Lists of a given type also include any subtypes.  
Consistent with the Annalist philosophy, type hierarchies can be adjusted 
dynamically and are not reflected in the data storage structure.
* option to edit existing referenced values from entity edit view, 
in addition to creating new values.
* in entity edit view, entity-reference dropdown lists display labels rather
than internal entity Ids, which it is hoped will lead to more user-friendly 
presentation when creating and editing entity data records.

Bug fixes are largeley to address some problems associated with file upload and resource import capabilities introduced in the previous release.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

Many of these changes have been driven by requirements coming from my work to capture the Carolan Guitar's digital footprint as linked data, which can be seen at http://localhost:8000/annalist/c/Carolan_Guitar/.
