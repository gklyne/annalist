### Announcing Annalist release 0.5.14

I've just released an update (release 0.5.14) of Annalist.

This is a maintenance release for more robust deployments, particularly for public web access.  The Annalist app uses a "production grade" web server; static files can be served directly by a front-end Apache or Nginx HTTP server; and deployment with HTTPS and LetsEncrypt certificates is more fully tested and documented.  There are also numerous smaller bug-fixes and improvements.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the 
[latest release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.5.md), 
[previous release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md) and via the 
[GitHub issues list](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues).

The Annalist demo site is at [annalist.net](http://annalist.net/), with links to several other introductory pages.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
