To Google group:

I've just released an update (0.1.16) to the public prototype of Annalist.

The main advances in this update are improvements to file uploads and resource imports, and changes to form rendering to make it easier to use media attachments.  (One strategy available is to use an entity type as a "media library" to which resources can be attached, and to provide new field rendering options to reference the attached resources and associated metadata.)  These new capabilities have been used to enhance the picture displays in the "CruisingLog" demo collection at http://demo.annalist.net/ (see definitions for `DailyLog`, `Place` and `Picture`).

Other changes include:

* Support for audio clips
* General rationalization of some aspects of the form rendering logic
* More test cases
* Documentation updates

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.
