### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.26

I've just released an update (0.1.26) to the public prototype of Annalist.  

The main change is support for a collection "default view" that can be a specific entity view.  This makes it possible to create a front page for a collection that provides a description and overview of the collection's content.

Other changes include usability and presentation improvements, and some bug fixes.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
