### Announcing Annalist release 0.5.16

I've just released an update (release 0.5.16) of Annalist.

This release consolidates and fixes problems with the previous "deployment hardening" release (0.5.14).  There was a problem with serving Turtle data, which has required a re-working of internal data-caching logic to allow multiple server threads, and another problem causing periodic loss of user login status.  Support has been added for collections to include arbitrary additonal web pages (HTML, JS, etc.).  And, as usual, there are a number of smaller bug fixes and enhancements.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the 
[latest release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.5.md), 
[previous release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md) and via the 
[GitHub issues list](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues).

The Annalist demo site is at [annalist.net](http://annalist.net/), with links to several other introductory pages.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
