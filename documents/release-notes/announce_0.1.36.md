### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.36

I've just released an update (0.1.36) to the public prototype of Annalist.

This is mainly a maintence release, with changes to support and management tooling and a new installable data collection.  There are relatively few changes to the core software.

Changes include:

* Server logging and log access enhancements.  Among other things, these make it possible for Annalist users withj site ADMIN permissions to view server logs without a shell login on the server host system.
* Additional command line tools for setting up initial user accounts.
* Improved control over default access permissions for a collection.
* Small internal changes and bug fixes to data migration logic.
* Improved reporting of some incorrectly defined view fields.
* New installable collection data (Concept_defs) with definitions for associating SKOS Concept tags with entities.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

The Annalist demo site front page is at [annalist.net](http://annalist.net/), with links to several other introductory pages.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
