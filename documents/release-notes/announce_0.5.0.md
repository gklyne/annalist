### Announcing Annalist release 0.5.0

I've just released an update (release 0.5.0) of Annalist.

This release represents a significant milestone, which I am proposing as candidate feature-complete functionality for an eventual version 1 release.  (It's been a long time coming - something like 2 years too long - for reasons that are not entirely technical.)

The aim has been to implement needed or desired features that are seen as likely to affect the stored data structures used by Annalist, to limit future data migration requirements.  The intent is to use this release in several projects to test if it offers minimal viable product functionality for its intended use.  Meanwhile, planned developments leading to a version 1 release will focus on documentation, stability, security and performance concerns.

If you have been thinking about using Annalist for creating linked data, or experimenting with linked data models, this would be a good release to consider trying it out and providing feedback.

Changes from the earlier 0.1.x public prototype releases include:

- Simplification the user interface for defining entity views, and changes to the underlying storage structure
- New automatic data migrations, and a new `annalist-manager` subcommand to migrate data for all collections in a site
- popup help for view fields (tooltip text) is defined seperately from for general help text in a field definition
- Installable collection `Journal_defs` has been split into `Resource_defs` and `Journal_defs`.
- Bug fixes and presentation tweaks
