### Announcing Annalist release 0.5.18

I've recently created an update (release 0.5.18) of Annalist.

This release marks the end of support for Python 2, and upgrades the version of Django used to the most recent currently available.  Security updates for dependencies have been applied.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the 
[latest release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.5.md), 
[previous release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md) and via the 
[GitHub issues list](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues).

The university-hosted Annalist demo site has been offline for some time (and I'm now retired from University employment).  There is currently a demo system running on my home server, but I'm not planning to publicize the address as the network connection isn't that great.  If necessary, I'll password-protect that system, but if you want to try it and explore, do ask me.  (In due course, I may reinstate the demo system on a cloud service provider, but I'm not currently seeing any need for that.)

at [annalist.net](http://annalist.net/), with links to several other introductory pages.

<!-- The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/ ), and -->

[Instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  An [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site (though may be somewhat dated).
