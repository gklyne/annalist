### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.28

I've just released an update (0.1.28) to the public prototype of Annalist.  

The main visible change is in the addition of customizable help and tooltip text when editing or viewing data.
This supports key documentation in the user interface itself, as well as in separate documentation files.

Also supported is the possibility to create a unified presentation of uploaded and linked data such as images and audio clips.  There are also some smaller usability enhancements and bug fixes.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
