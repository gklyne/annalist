### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.30

I've just released an update (0.1.30) to the public prototype of Annalist.  

This release provides improvements to data evolution, collection management, user interface changes aimed at facilitating collection navigation, and bug fixes.  It also advances the support for modular collections in `annalist_manager`, and provides some installable collection definitions.

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

The Annalist live demo system is at [demo.annalist.net](http://demo.annalist.net/annalist/site/), and [instructions for installing Annalist](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/installing-annalist.md) are available from, the [Annalist GitHub project](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist).  The [Annalist tutorial](http://annalist.net/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.html) is also available from the demo system site.
