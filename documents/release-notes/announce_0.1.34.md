### Announcing Annalist release 0.1.34

After an extended hiatus due to some upheaval in my personal life, I've just released an update (0.1.34) to the public prototype of Annalist.  This release provides numerous enhancements and bug fixes, as well revision of the file storage layout used to make URLs used more consistent.  

Enhancements include:

* Data storage layout changes, affecting URLs used to access data
* Automatic migration of old collection data to new layout
* More consistent URL structure using either `file:` or `http:` URLs.
* Fixes to installable collection data.
* Fix some login and accesscontrol problems
* Fix some installation problems, particularly relating to installable collection data
* Documentation and built-in help text enhancements

More details can be found in the "History" section of the [release notes](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/master/documents/release-notes/release-v0.1.md), and via the GitHub issues list.

The Annalist demo site front page is at [annalist.net](http://annalist.net/), with links to several other introductory pages.
