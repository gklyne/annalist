> I've got an account, how do I start my own 'journal'?

1. Create a new collection as described at https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/develop/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.adoc#creating-a-new-collection  (Note that the collection Id must consist of letters, digits and '_' characters, without spaces or other punctuation.)

2. Edit metadata for your new collection as described at https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/blob/develop/documents/tutorial/annalist-tutorial.adoc#change-collection-metadata

3. On the form displayed, select "Journal and Resource definitions" in the "Parent" field, and click "Save".  (This imports journal entry definitions from collection "Journal_defs".)

4. Back on the front page, click on the link for the new collection you just created.  

5. In the "List" field, select "Journal entries" from the dropdown list, then click the "List" button.  An empty list of journal entries is displayed.  Click on "New" to create a new entry.



By default,new entries are created with a numeric Id (e.g. 00000001), which can be overridden with something more meaningful, or left as-is.  The entity id must consist of letters, digits and/or '_' characters, without spaces or other punctuation.

(You don't have to create "Journal entries", but it seemed that might be useful starting point for experimentation.)
