## Can I Import an existing OWL ontology (or subset thereof)?

Not yet, as of 2017-05.

OWL and/or RDFS class and property declarations could be extracted and exported from definitions created with Annalist.  (There is already some logic in this direction used to create JSON-LD context files from Annalist definitions.)

_(Added to Roadmap 2017-05-18)_
