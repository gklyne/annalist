## Can I Import an existing OWL ontology (or subset thereof)?

Not yet, as of 2017-05.

It is possible to create Annalist definitions that work with data that uses terms from an existing ontology, or indedd multiple ontologies.  (This is what I have done with my work on Carolan and performance descriptions, drawing on elements from CIDOC-CRM, PROV, MO and more.

The Annalist definitions combine ontology/schema information with presentation details, so there isn't a single way of presenting data based on a given Ontology in Annalist.  Therefore, a fully automated conversion from an existing ontology may not be possible or the most effective way of using Annalist.  However, I do think it would be an interesting possibility to create initial Annalist definitions from an existing ontology, which can subsequently be edited and refined by hand to create a more effective presentation.
