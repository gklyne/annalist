% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% ================= IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS =======================
% Questions regarding the SIGS styles, SIGS policies and
% procedures, Conferences etc. should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti (griscti@acm.org)
%
% Technical questions _only_ to
% Gerald Murray (murray@hq.acm.org)
% ===============================================================

% For tracking purposes - this is V2.0 - May 2012

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should

% Annalist is a software system for individuals and small groups to reap the benefits of using RDF linked data, creating data that participates in a wider web of linked data.  It presents a flexible web interface for creating, editing and browsing evolvable data, without requiring the user to be familiar with minutiae of the RDF model or syntax, or to perform any programming, HTML coding or prior configuration.

Annalist is a software system for individuals and small groups to reap the benefits of using RDF linked data, supporting them to easily create data that participates in a wider web of linked data. It presents a flexible web interface for creating, editing and browsing evolvable data, without requiring the user to be familiar with minutiae of the RDF model or syntax, or to perform any programming, HTML coding or prior configuration.

Development of Annalist was motivated by data capture and sharing concerns in a small bioinformatics research group, and customized personal information management.  Requirements centre particularly on achieving low activation energy for simple tasks, flexibility to add structural details as data is collected, access-controlled sharing, and ability to connect private data with public data on the web.  It is designed as a web server application, presenting an interface for defining data structure and managing data.  Data is stored as text files that are amenable to access by existing software, with the intent that a range of applications may be used in concert to gather, manage and publish data.

During its development, Annalist has been used in a range of applications, which have informed decisions about its design and proven its flexibility and robustness in use. It has been particularly effective in exploring and rapid prototyping designs for linked data on the web, covering science and humanities research, creative art and personal information.
