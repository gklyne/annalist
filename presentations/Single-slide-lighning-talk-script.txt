## A gap in the landscape

I believe there is a gap in the landscape of tool 
provision for data sharing, particularly by 
individuals and small workgroups.

This gap lies somewhere between users' personal 
desktops and the various community data publication 
and sharing platforms that exist.

What I think is missing is a tool that can be used 
out-of-the-box to gather and manage data, yes 
also supporting:

* evolution
  by allowing structure to be developed 
  as data is gathered

* collaboration
  through controlled sharing with colleagues, and

* reuse and remixing
  by creating data that can be combined with 
  external sources








## Annalist

The Annalist linked data notebook attempts to bridge 
this gap, allowing simple data to be gathered and 
viewed, out-of-the-box and without prior configuration 
(e.g. something like a deck of index cards), 
but also allowing structure to be added as needed.
  
Annalist also allows one to start with a defined "core" 
data schema, and add elements and structure to it as 
data is gathered.


## Status

Annalist is currently a work in progress, 
what I call a "public prototype".  
There is substantial completed functionality, but 
I feel it is not yet a minimum viable product.

There is a live demonstrator running at annalist.net.

From the outset, Annalist has been an open development, 
with source, documentation, and more hosted on Github.

Looking to the future, I am interested in 
collaborating on applications of Annalist, 
to guide and support its further development,
with a view to it eventually becoming 
a self-sustaining community project.

For more information, please grab hold of me, and/or 
visit annalist.net.
