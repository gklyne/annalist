## A gap in the landscape

I believe there is a gap in the landscape of tool 
provision for data sharing, particularly by 
individuals and small workgroups.

This gap lies somewhere between users' personal 
desktops and the various data publication platforms

What I think is missing is a tool that can be used out-of-the-box for gathering and managing data, and that also supports:

* evolution
  by allowing structure to be developed 
  as data is gathered

* collaboration
  through controlled sharing with colleagues, and

* reuse and remixing
  by creating data that can be recombined with 
  external sources





## Annalist

The Annalist linked data notebook attempts to fill 
this gap, allowing simple data to be gathered and 
viewed without any prior configuration 
(e.g. something like a deck of index cards), 
but also allowing structure to be added as needed.
  
It also allows one to start with a defined "core" 
structure and add additional details as needs emerge.


## Status

The current status is that Annalist is a work in 
progress, what I call a "public prototype".  
There is substantial completed functionality, but I
feel it is not yet a minimum viable product.

There is a live demonstration running at annalist.net, which I encourage you to visit.

Annalist development has been open from the outset, 
with source, documentation, and more hosted on Github.

In the future, I am interested in collaborations 
to work on applications of Annalist, 
to guide and support its further development,
with a view to it eventually becoming 
a self-sustaining community project.

For more information, please grab hold of me, and/or visit annalist.net.
