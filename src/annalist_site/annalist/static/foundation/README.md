# Foundation CSS and JS files

Files in this directory are a straight copy from the Foundfation 5.03 kit.

I'm keeping the Foundation fiules separate from other static files so that:
(a) it's easier to upgrade to a new erelease of foundation
(b) in due course I can use SASS to customize the Foundation CSS without
    getting mixed up with hand-generated CSS files.

I'm adding these files to thne project got reprository, but files in this
directory MUST NOT be hand-edited: any such edits are at risk of being 
discarded without notice.
