Entity types provide a high-level distinction between the things described in a collection.\r\n\r\nEach entity type corresponds to a set of stored entity records.  Structurally, entity types form a flat (non-hierarchical) space, but each type may declare one or more supertype URIs so that its members are included in selections of the indicated supertype."
