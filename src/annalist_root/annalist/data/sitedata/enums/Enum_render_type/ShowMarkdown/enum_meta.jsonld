These substitutions are mainly intended to make it easier to place links to collection data in the field text, but other uses may introduced later.\r\n\r\n* `$$name` followed by a non-alphanumeric character other than '_' or ':'.\r\n* `$$name:`\r\n*  `$$[curie]`\r\n*  `$$$$`\r\n\r\nIn the first two, `name` consists of a sequence of alphabetic, numeric or '_' \r\ncharacters.  In the third pattern, `curie` may contain several additional characters that may occur \r\nin a compact URI (CURIE).\r\n\r\nThe final pattern is an escape sequence for inserting a single '$' into the output \r\nwhich might otherwise be treated as a value substitution.\r\n\r\nThe substituted values are taken from Annalist's internal \"display context\", which contains many values.  Specific values for creating links are:\r\n\r\n* `$$HOST` - URL for the host running the current Annalist site.\r\n* `$$SITE` - URL for the the current Annalist site.\r\n* `$$COLL` - URL for the the current Annalist collection.\r\n* `$$BASE:` - base URI for entities in the current collection.  Use this to create links to entities in the following form: `$$BASE:type_id/entity_id` \r\n\r\nIf no corresponding context value is found for a substitution pattern, the pattern is\r\ncopied as-is to the output.  Any other occurrence of `$` (i.e. not part of any pattern described above) is unchanged.\r\n"
