This is a textual expression that defines selection criteria.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    'entity[annal:record_type] subtype [annal:field_entity_type]'\r\n\r\nThe filter operates by comparing fields from a entity under consideration with a field from the containing entity, or from the view that is used to display it.\r\n\r\nSelector formats:\r\n\r\n    ALL (or blank)              match any entity\r\n    <val1> == <val2>            values are the same.\r\n    <val1> in <val2>            second value is list containing 1st value, or values are same, or <val1> is None.\r\n    <val1> subtype <val2>       first value is a subtype of, or the same type as, the second value.\r\n\r\n`<val1>` and `<val2>` may be:\r\n\r\n    [<field-id>]                refers to field of field under consideration for inclusion\r\n    entity[<field-id>]          refers to field of containing entity.\r\n    view[<field-id>]            refers to field of the view used to display the containing entity.\r\n    \"<string>\"                  literal string value.
