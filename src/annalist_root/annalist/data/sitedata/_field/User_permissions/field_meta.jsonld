As a site-wide permission, also permits creating new collections, and deleting existing ones.\r\n* `CREATE_COLLECTION` - as a site-wide permission, permits creating new collections.  Any created collections automatically grant `ADMIN` permission to the user who creates them.\r\n* `DELETE_COLLECTION` - as a site-wide permission, permits deletion of any collection.\r\n* `CONFIG` - permits definition and modification of collection structures (types, views, lists, fields, etc.).\r\n* `VIEW` - permits viewing of data records.\r\n* `CREATE` - permits creation of new data records.\r\n* `UPDATE` - permits modification of existing data records.\r\n* `DELETE` - permits deletion of existing data reciords.\r\n\r\nSite wide permissions are listed at [_annalist_site/l/User_list/]($SITE:c/_annalist_site/l/User_list/)."
