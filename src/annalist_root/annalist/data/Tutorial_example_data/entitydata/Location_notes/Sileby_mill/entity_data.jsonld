  "rdfs:comment": "# Sileby Mill\r\n\r\nOld mill, boatyard, lock, and weir stream, on the River Soar between Mountsorrel and Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe location feels very remote, but is about a mile from Sileby and Mountsorrel, and even closer to the A6 main road between Leicester and Loughborough.  There are footpaths across the flood plain, to Sileby and Mountsorrel.\r\n",
