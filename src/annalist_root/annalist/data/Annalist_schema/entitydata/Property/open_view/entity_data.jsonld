In view mode, it allows navigation of the view definition structure to discover details of how the form is constructed from entity data.\r\n\r\nView that are intended to be fixed (including most built-in views) may specify a value of `false` for this field, in which case the option to view or edit the view definition is not offered.\r\n",
