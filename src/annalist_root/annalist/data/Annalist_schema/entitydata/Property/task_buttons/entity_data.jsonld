It references a list of internal resources, each of which defines a button id, button label and tooltip help text for the button (see example below).\r\n\r\nThe declared button id must correspond to a defined task; when the button is clicked while editing an entity, that task is invoked.  (Currently, the only tasks are those predefined by Annalist, but future revisions may also support user-definable tasks.)\r\n\r\nDifferent task buttons may be defined separately for editing and view displays by using properties `annal:edit_task_buttons` and  `annal:view_task_buttons`.\r\n\r\nSee also: `annal:button_id`, `annal:button_label` and `annal:button_help`.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nTaken from Annalist's internal definition of the field definition view:\r\n\r\n        {\r\n          :\r\n          \"annal:edit_task_buttons\":\r\n            [ { \"annal:button_id\":        \"_task/Define_many_field\" \r\n              , \"annal:button_label\":     \"Define repeat field\"\r\n              , \"annal:button_help\":      \"Define new field that allows zero, one or more occurrences of the current field.
