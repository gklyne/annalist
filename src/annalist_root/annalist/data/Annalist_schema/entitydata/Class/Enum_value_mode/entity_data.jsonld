This value is used together with a render type vcalue to control the process of rendering a field in a view or a list.\r\n\r\nThe majority of fields are used with a value mode of `Value_direct`, which indicates that the field value is taken directly from the identified field of the containing entity.  In a few cases, rendered field values are retrieved from a referenced entity or web resource, for which alternative value modes may be used.",
