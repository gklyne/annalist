A user permissions instance is associated with an Annalist collection or site, and associates a user id + URI (typically based on an authenticated email address) with a set of permissions applicable for that user in the associated collection, or across the Annaist site.  Collection permissions override site-wide permissions.\r\n\r\nTwo special user URIs are recognized:\r\n\r\n1. `annal:User/_default_user_perms`: permissions applied to any authenticated user for whom explicit permissions are not definbed\r\n2. `annal:User/_unknown_user_perms`: permissions applied to access requests by unauthenticated users.\r\n",
