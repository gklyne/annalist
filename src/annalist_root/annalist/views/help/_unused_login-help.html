<h1>Login page</h1>
<p>The intended means of user authentication is via a third party service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter a local username (which is how Annalist will identify you, independently of any third party authentication account you may use), select an identity provider (IDP) (e.g. 'Google') and click 'Login'.</li>
<li>If you are not already logged in to the IDP you will be asked to login via their site.  Then the IDP will ask your permission to disclose basic identifying information (email, first name and last name) to Annalist.  This step is skipped if you have completed these actions previously.</li>
<li>If this is an existing annalist account, and the email from the IDP matches the Annalist account email, you will be logged in.  If the username given does not match an existing Annalist account, a new account is created with the appropriate details and you are logged in to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local user accounts (e.g. created by an admin user using the 'admin' link on the page footer) can be used by clicking on the "Local user credentials" <strong>login</strong> link.</p>
<p>Being logged in does not necessarily mean you have permissions to access Annalist data;  it simply means that Annalist has an indicator of who you are.</p>
<p>(Currently, the authorization system is not fully implememted, and all authenticated users have full access to the Annalist data, but that will change before the first non-prototype software release.  See <a href="https://github.com/gklyne/annalist/issues/11">Annalist issue 11</a>)</p>
